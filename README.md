# CLIO

CLIO is an Elixir library for displaying data in the terminal (and not only).
Most of us, developers spend their time mostly in the terminal, so it is a good
way to have some small scripts wirtten that update us for news or data or whatever.

## Installation

It is [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish) and the package can be installed
by adding `clio` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:clio, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```
